# Project
Smart Dog Door System that uses AI image recognition and Arduino-controlled hardware to improve safety for pets and homeowners. The idea is that the dog door stays locked by default. When the system detects an image of a real dog , a signal is sent to the Arduino, which then unlocks the door.
